# Day 1: Introduction to Networking 🌐

## Objectives
* Understand the roles of host, server, and network intermediaries.
* Distinguish between LANs, Routers, and Firewalls.
* Build a basic corporate topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Key Concepts Learned
* **Intermediary Devices:** Switches (LAN connectivity) vs. Routers (Inter-LAN/Internet connectivity).
* **Firewalls:** Hardware (Network-based) vs. Software (Host-based) filtering.
* **Client/Server Model:** A device can act as a server or a client depending on the situation.

## Lab Topology
Implemented a "Two-Branch" network (New York & Tokyo) connected via the Internet, protected by Cisco ASA Firewalls.
